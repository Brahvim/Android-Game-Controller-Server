# Android-Game-Controller-Server

Initially *reborn* as part of my *college minor-project*, this is an app that'll help you control a PC with a re-programmable *virtual controller* on a touch-screen!

This is the server-side app. For the client-side one, see [this page](https://github.com/Brahvim/Android-Game-Controller-Client)!

For the legacy version of this app *(the server-app)*, see [AndroidGameControllerLegacy](https://github.com/Brahvim/AndroidGameControllerLegacy) and [AndroidGameControllerServerLegacy](https://github.com/Brahvim/AndroidGameControllerServerLegacy).
